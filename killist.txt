        -PvP Regions

-Distance based combat
-PvE until multiplayer setup

-Map size: 10000 star systems? Region count scales approximately with map size

-Factions: players can group up into a faction/clan
    Factions have additional benefits such as a combined base, pooled resources, etc. Players can travel with other faction members as a fleet to complete group missions and other operations.

    Defecting players take 300% damage from the faction they left, decaying 1% per hour, to discourage faction hopping during wars.

    Factions can battle over map ownership, taking over star systems and trade hubs. Diplomacy and drama encouraged.

-Income:
   Numerous jobs/contracts:
   -PvE contracts such as deliveries, escorts, resource collection, battling
   -PvP bounties, raiding enemy faction stations 

-Faction income:
  -Trade hub ownership. Factions get a small cut of the daily goods
  -PvP raids
  -Donations 

  -Combat:
  -Optional in PvE areas, both parties must agree to a battle
  -Range based, strike craft, support ships and long range weapons have a flight delay on them and are limited to within a few systems away, depending on tech level
 -Short range weapons work roughly as a normal battle would go
 -Trade hubs / central galaxy ceasefire areas combat is not allowed at all
 -All combat happens in real time
-Player Fleet:
  -Base ship, the ship the player commands primarily
  -Escort cruisers, both for combat, support, or carrying supplies
  -Strike craft included as part of base ship once unlocked
  -Max command limit based on player command level, up to 15? escort cruisers

  -Player:
  -Spawn with base ship and coin to upgrade ship minorly
  -Spawn in PvE zone
  -If taken out in combat, emergency warp will activate in PvE, ship destroyed in PvP (except in PvE zone duels)
  -Player given option to reconstruct ship if they have sufficient coin on ship destruction. Additionally, faction shipyards can fund this too

-Travelling:
  -Travelling done in real time, a full cross map journey should take 3? days not using hyperlanes
 -Hyperlanes boost flight speed but are only in certain areas, like roads
